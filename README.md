# Open Game Engine

The Open Game Engine is a game engine developed using C++ and OpenGL for the purpose of knowledge and study. It is specifically designed to support 3D games and utilizes the Entity Component System (ECS) architecture to provide flexibility and modularity in game development.

## Features

- Full support for 3D games.
- Entity Component System (ECS) architecture for a flexible and modular game structure.
- Handling of keyboard, mouse, and gamepad inputs for player interactivity.
- Implementation of 3D model loading for rendering complex objects.
- Planned: support for 2D games.
- Planned: 3D and 2D physics for realistic object simulations and collisions.
- Planned: audio for immersive sound effects.
- Planned: animation for smooth character and object movement.

## Dependencies

The Open Game Engine relies on the following libraries:

- OpenGL: for 3D graphics rendering.
- GLFW: for window management and input handling.
- GLM: for mathematics and vector operations.
- Assimp: for 3D model importing.
- Planned: a physics library for object simulation and collisions.
- Planned: an audio library for sound playback and effects.
- Planned: an animation library for controlling movements and transitions.

Make sure to install the necessary dependencies before compiling and running the Open Game Engine.
